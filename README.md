This Plugin gives you all the tools you need to out rank your competitors in local search.

With the Premium Plugin you are able to track more keywords, optimize more landing pages, utilize more search data and analyze more of your competitors data.

The premium version also allows you to seamlessly create or correct all business listing errors found in the business listing scan.  You will also have additional monitoring and local listing updating features for things like announcing sales.
